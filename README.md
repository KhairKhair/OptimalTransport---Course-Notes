These notes were developed as part of a directed study undertaken as a mathematics elective during my senior year, under the supervision of Professor Michel Pavon.
The project consisted of weekly lectures prepared and delivered by me, which were attended by Professor Pavon and, on some occasions, by other participants.

The material is primarily based on the book Statistical Optimal Transport by Chewi, Niles-Weed, and Rigollet, along with additional references where appropriate.
The aim of these notes is to provide an accessible, intuition-driven introduction to optimal transport and Wasserstein gradient flows, with an emphasis on concepts relevant to computer science, optimization, and statistics.

The exposition reflects the perspective of an undergraduate student learning the subject and is intended mainly for other undergraduate computer science students who are interested in the mathematical foundations and modern applications of optimal transport.
